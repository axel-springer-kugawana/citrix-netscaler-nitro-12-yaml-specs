# citrix-netscaler-nitro-yaml-specs

Yaml specifications of the Citrix Netscaler nitro api

This project modelizes the Netscaler nitro configuration api using yaml files.

A resource is described through a key that uniquely identifies an instance, a list of fields, eventually a state, and a list of updatable fields.
A binding is described through a source and target resources, plus optional fields that describe the binding.
At the difference of a resource, a binding can not be updated/renamed.

These specs are used to automate the creation of the following projects :
- [Netscaler Nitro client written in go](https://github.com/doubret/citrix-netscaler-nitro-go-client)
- [Terraform provider plugin for Netscaler](https://github.com/doubret/citrix-netscaler-nitro-go-client)

## Documentations

You can find the documentation describing the format of the resource and binding yaml files here :
- [Yaml file format for resources](doc/formats/resource.md)
- [Yaml file format for bindings](doc/formats/binding.md)
